# Local Chat

With local chat, you can chat with your geeks (actually just with one geek temporarily) in a local network. Wanna test for fun? Here how to use it :)

# Set Up
Step 1: You set up your server on your side (or on your friend side)
```
\your\path> python tcp_server.py
```
Step 2: Set up the client on the other side
```
\your\path> python tcp_client.py
```
Step 3: Enjoy your time :)
